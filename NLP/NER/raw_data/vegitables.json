name consisted of a generic name combined with a specific name that was from one to several words long.", "Together they formed a system of polynomial nomenclature.", "These names had two separate functions.", "First to designate or label the species and second to be a diagnosis or description however these two goals were eventually found to be incompatible.", "In a simple genus containing only two species it was easy to tell them apart with a one word genus and a one word specific name but as more species were discovered the names necessarily became longer and unwieldy for instance Plantago

phrases are short descriptions rather than identifying labels.", "The Bauhins in particular Caspar Bauhin 1560 1624 took some important steps towards the binomial system by pruning the Latin descriptions in many cases to two words.", "The adoption by biologists of a system of strictly binomial nomenclature is due to Swedish botanist and physician Carl Linnaeus 1707 1778.", "It was in Linnaeus s 1753 Species Plantarum that he began consistently using a one word trivial name nomen triviale after a generic name genus name in a system of binomial nomenclature.", "Trivial names had already appeared in his Critica Botanica 1737 and Philosophia Botanica 1751.", "This trivial name is what is now known as a specific epithet ICNafp or specific name ICZN.", "The Bauhins genus names were retained in many of these but the descriptive part was reduced to a single word.", "Linnaeus s trivial names introduced an important new idea namely that the function of a name could simply be to give a species a unique label.", "This meant that the name no longer need be descriptive for example both parts could be derived from the names of people.", "Thus Gerard s Phalangium ephemerum virginianum became Tradescantia virginiana where the genus name honoured John Tradescant the Younger an English botanist and gardener.", "A bird in the parrot family was named Psittacus alexandri

Zoological and Botanical Bacterial and Viral Nomenclature provide Economy.", "Compared to the polynomial system which it replaced a binomial name is shorter and easier to remember.", "It corresponds to the widespread system of family name plus given name s used to name people in many cultures.", "The binomial system of nomenclature is governed by international codes and is used by biologists

example when species are transferred between genera as not uncommonly happens as a result of new knowledge the second part of the binomial is kept the same unless it becomes a homonym.", "Thus there is disagreement among botanists as to whether the genera Chionodoxa and Scilla are sufficiently different for them to be kept separate.", "Those who keep them separate give the plant commonly grown in gardens in Europe the name Chionodoxa siehei those who do not give it the name Scilla siehei.", "The siehei element is constant.", "Similarly if what were previously thought to be two distinct species are demoted to a lower rank such as subspecies the second part of the binomial name is retained as a trinomen the third part of the new name.", "Thus the Tenerife robin may be treated as a different species from the European robin in which case its name is Erithacus superbus or as only a subspecies in which case its name is Erithacus rubecula superbus.", "The superbus element of the name is constant as is its authorship and year of publication.", "Binomial nomenclature for species has the effect that when a species is moved from one genus to another sometimes the specific name or epithet must be changed as well.", "This may happen because the specific name is already used in the new genus or to agree in gender with the new genus if the specific epithet is an adjective modifying the genus name.", "Some biologists have argued for the combination of the genus name and specific epithet into a single unambiguous name or for the use of uninomials as used in nomenclature of ranks above species.", "Because genus names are unique only within a nomenclature code it is possible for two or more species to share the same genus name and even the same binomial if they occur in different kingdoms.", "At least 1 240 instances of genus name duplication occur mainly between zoology and botany.", "Nomenclature including binomial nomenclature is not the same as classification although the two are related.", "Classification is the ordering of items into groups based on similarities or differences in biological classification species are one of the kinds of item to be classified.", "In principle the names given to species could be completely independent of their classification.", "This is not the case for binomial names since the first part of a binomial is the name of the genus into which the species is placed.", "Above the rank of genus binomial nomenclature and classification are partly independent for example a species retains its binomial name if it is moved from one family to another or from one order to another unless it better fits a different genus in the same or different family or it is split from its old genus and placed in a newly created genus.", "The independence is only partial since the names of families and other higher taxa are usually based on genera.", "Taxonomy includes both nomenclature and classification.", "Its first stages sometimes called alpha taxonomy are concerned with finding describing and naming species of living or fossil organisms.", "Binomial nomenclature is thus an important part of taxonomy as it is the system by which species are named.", "Taxonomists are also concerned with classification including its principles procedures and rules.", "A complete binomial name is always treated grammatically as if it were a phrase in the Latin language hence the common use of the term Latin name for a binomial name.", "However the two parts of a binomial name can each be derived from a number of sources of which Latin is only one.", "These include Latin either classical or medieval.", "Thus both parts of the binomial name Homo sapiens are Latin words meaning wise sapiens human man Homo.", "The genus Rhododendron was named by Linnaeus from the Greek word itself derived from rhodon rose and dendron tree.", "Greek words are often converted to a Latinized form.", "Thus coca the plant from which cocaine is obtained has the name Erythroxylum coca.", "Erythroxylum is derived from the Greek words erythros red and xylon wood.", "The Greek neuter ending on is often converted to the Latin neuter ending um.",

the binomial name of the lion which is Panthera leo.", "Grammatically the noun is said to be in apposition to the genus name and the two nouns do not have to agree in gender in this case Panthera is feminine and leo is masculine.", "The second part of a binomial may be a noun in the genitive possessive case.", "The genitive case is constructed in a number of ways in Latin depending on the declension of the noun.", "Common endings for masculine and neuter nouns are ii or i in the singular and orum in the plural and for feminine nouns ae in the singular and arum in the plural.", "The noun may be part of a person s name often the surname as in the Tibetan antelope Pantholops hodgsonii the shrub Magnolia hodgsonii or the olive backed pipit Anthus hodgsoni.", "The meaning is of the person named so that Magnolia hodgsonii means Hodgson s magnolia.", "The ii or i endings show that in each case Hodgson was a man not the same one had Hodgson been a woman hodgsonae would have been used.", "The person commemorated in the binomial name is not usually if ever the person who created the name for example Anthus hodgsoni was named by Charles Wallace Richmond in honour of Hodgson.", "Rather than a person the noun may be related to a place as with Latimeria chalumnae meaning of the Chalumna River.", "Another use of genitive nouns is in for example the name of the bacterium Escherichia coli where coli means of the colon.", "This formation is common in parasites as in Xenos vesparum where vesparum means of the wasps since Xenos vesparum is a parasite of wasps.", "Whereas the first part of a binomial name must be unique within the purview of each nomenclatural code the second part is quite commonly used in two or more genera as is shown by examples of hodgsonii

converted to a specific epithet.", "In particular names ending in a consonant but not er are treated as first being converted into Latin by adding ius for a man or ia for a woman and then being made genitive i.", "meaning of that person or persons.", "This produces specific epithets like lecardii for Lecard male wilsoniae for Wilson female and brauniarum for the Braun sisters.", "By contrast the ICZN does not require the intermediate creation of a Latin form of a personal name allowing the genitive ending to be added directly to the personal name.", "This explains the difference between the
